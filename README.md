PetHealthAI

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on:

1. Analyzing and predicting cure rates for feline and canine distemper using collected health data.


2. Identifying and classifying pet skin diseases through image recognition models, providing efficient diagnostic support for veterinarians and pet owners.



Project Overview

PetHealthAI is designed to address key challenges in pet healthcare by leveraging artificial intelligence. Our goal is to develop predictive models and diagnostic tools to:

Assist veterinarians in making data-driven treatment decisions for feline and canine distemper.

Improve early detection and classification of pet skin diseases to provide timely care.


This project combines advanced machine learning algorithms, image processing techniques, and real-world health data to create a comprehensive AI-powered diagnostic tool.

Why Code and Data Are Not Yet Uploaded

We are currently in the data collection and preprocessing phase, which is critical to ensure the model is trained on high-quality, representative datasets. Simultaneously, we are designing the initial architecture for both predictive and image recognition models.

The following steps are in progress:

Aggregating and anonymizing pet health records.

Collecting labeled images of pet skin conditions for training the recognition model.

Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to refine features for model training.


As this foundational work is completed, we will begin uploading code and documentation to this repository in phases.

Timeline for Uploads

We are committed to transparency and collaboration. Below is the expected timeline for repository updates:

1. Phase 1: Data Preparation (Expected: Q1 2025)

Preprocessed datasets (where possible, anonymized samples).

EDA scripts and initial findings.



2. Phase 2: Model Prototypes (Expected: Q2 2025)

Initial versions of the cure rate prediction and skin disease recognition models.

Training scripts and performance benchmarks.



3. Phase 3: Deployment and Optimization (Expected: Q3 2025)

Refined models with enhanced accuracy.

Documentation for model deployment and use cases.




How This Project Benefits the Community

By developing these tools, PetHealthAI aims to:

Empower veterinarians with AI insights to improve treatment outcomes for pets.

Support pet owners by providing accurate and accessible diagnostic capabilities.

Contribute to the growing field of AI-driven veterinary medicine.
